# VF-1
Name: Anti-GDF-15 humanized monoclonal antibody
Background: VitaForge anti-GDF15 antibody, VF-1, is a novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody designed to block GDF15–GFRAL–RET signaling with high affinity and specificity. By inhibiting this stress-response cytokine pathway, VF-1 has shown strong activity in preclinical models, where it effectively suppresses downstream signaling and prevents GDF15-driven body weight loss and cachexia-related symptoms. This positions VF-1 as a promising investigational therapy for cancer- and disease-associated cachexia and other GDF15‑mediated metabolic complications.

# VF-2
Name: Arginine tRNA Suppressor Gene Therapy
Background: VitaForge VF-2 is a preclinical, AAV-delivered gene therapy designed to correct age-related nonsense mutations by using a codon-suppressor system to restore full-length, functional proteins. Early in vivo data show that VF-2 distributes to multiple organs, appears well tolerated over short-term studies, and aims to address mutations in key genes involved in DNA repair, tumor suppression, and neurodegeneration, positioning it as a potentially first-in-class longevity-focused genetic medicine.
